# nUndertale


Have you ever played Undertale and thought to yourself, "This is great and all, but what if it was a parody game where instead of a child falling into the underground, it was Pepe the frog and all the monsters were furries that you had to beat the crap out of?" Well, look no further, because that's exactly what nUndertale is!

## Overview


nUndertale is a comedic parody of the popular game Undertale, developed in C using the Allegro graphics library. In nUndertale, the player takes on the role of Pepe the frog, who has fallen into an underground world filled with furries instead of monsters. Unlike the original game, there is no option to spare the furries, only to fight them. If the player loses a battle, Pepe becomes more and more of a furry until eventually losing the game.

The game is still in early development, but currently features functional menus that allow the player to start a new game, load a saved game, access game settings, and quit the game. As the game progresses, new features will be added, including battles with furries and branching story paths based on the player's decisions.

## Technical Details

nUndertale is written in C, using the Allegro graphics library to handle rendering and user input. The code is well-organized and includes comments throughout to help with understanding and maintenance. However, some assets may not be included due to licensing issues.

## How to Play

At the moment, there is no actual gameplay in nUndertale, just functional menus. To start a new game, select "New Game" from the main menu. To load a saved game, select "Load Game". The game settings menu allows the player to adjust the volume and screen resolution. To quit the game, select "Quit".

## Origin

The idea for Nundertale was born during a late-night Discord call, when the creator decided to remake Undertale from scratch using C programming language and the Allegro graphics library. The concept quickly evolved into a parody game that would poke fun at the original's gameplay mechanics and story.

## Conclusion

nUndertale is a fun and lighthearted parody of Undertale that will have players laughing and enjoying themselves. While still in early development, the functional menus provide a glimpse into what the game will eventually become.
